# Blu's Best Boxes
This repository provides you with all CSS, HTML, and Markdown includes to utilize Blu's best boxes. These boxes are great for organizing wiki pages, providing differences between IC information and OOC information, such as what is known in the theme and how to utilize certain things within the stats system. You can see in the main repository the images for each box; the name of the image matches the folder with that particular CSS styling, HTML, and Markdown.

## Important Notes
When adding the HTML, you should *not* format it into its own lines and indentations. Markdown loathes indents, and it also will force a paragraph `<p>` with each carriage return.

You should utilize `<br/>` within the includes for carriage returns. To add links, you will also want to use HTML to create those links.

The CSS styling utilizes the Basic Blu theme, but can be easily adapted to your own theme.

## Boxes Included
* The Basic Info Box: this is a great way to organize IC and OOC information about things like creatures in bestiaries, known threats, or other information that requires delination between IC and OOC information.
* The Basic Info Box, but small: Same as above, but smaller for more compact information. See the details on this box to learn how to put this into two columns for even tighter layouts.
* The Page Box: this is a neat way to add links to main theme pages that includes snippets of what to find on that page (special thanks to KarmaBum and AlmightyMe for providing the initial code for this box, and Ren for adding the FontAwesome icon, all of which have seen lots of evolutions over time).
* NPC Box: this box can be used for a lot of things, but was originally designed for NPC info boxes.
* NPC Box, small: smaller version of the box above.
* Advantage Box: as there is not a system page for Advantages that can provide more details, this box is a great way to add Advantages details.
